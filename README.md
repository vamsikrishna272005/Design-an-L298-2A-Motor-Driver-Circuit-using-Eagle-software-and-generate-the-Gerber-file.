## Exp 5: Design an L298 2A Motor Driver Circuit using Eagle software and generate the Gerber file.

# AIM:
To design the schematic and PCB layout diagram of an L298 2A Motor Driver Circuit using Eagle software.
# EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
●	Hardware: Personal Computer (PC)<br>
●	Software: Eagle <br>
# PROCEDURE:
	Create a New Project:<br>
o	Launch EAGLE and start a new project for your PCB design.<br>
o	Within the project, create a new schematic file.<br>
	Add Components:<br>
o	Utilize the built-in libraries in EAGLE or create custom libraries if needed.<br>
o	Use the 'Add' tool to place the required components onto the schematic sheet.<br>
	Make Connections:<br>
o	Connect the components using the 'Net' tool.<br>
o	Label the nets clearly to maintain clarity and organization in your design.<br>
	Check for Errors:<br>
o	Once the schematic design is complete, perform an Electrical Rule Check (ERC) to identify and correct any errors.<br>
o	Save the schematic after confirming that no errors are present.<br>
	Switch to Board Layout:<br>
o	Click on the 'Generate/Switch to Board' button to create the PCB layout from the schematic.<br>
	Arrange Components and Route Traces:<br>
o	In the board layout editor, arrange the components to optimize space and reduce signal interference.<br>
o	Use the 'Route' tool to connect the components based on the schematic design.<br>
o	Ensure proper routing by utilizing the available editing tools in EAGLE to avoid design rule violations.<br>
	Design Rule Check (DRC):<br>
o	Perform a Design Rule Check (DRC) to ensure that the routing and layout comply with design standards and that there are no issues.<br>
o	Save the board layout after resolving any errors.<br>
	Generate Gerber Files:<br>
o	Go to File > CAM Processor and configure the CAM jobs to generate Gerber files for all PCB layers, such as copper layers, silkscreen, solder mask, and drill files.<br>
o	Verify the generated files to ensure they contain all necessary information for manufacturing.<br>
	Save Manufacturing Files:<br>
o	Save the Gerber files and any other required manufacturing files to send to your PCB manufacturer for fabrication.<br>
# THEORY:
The L298 is a dual H-Bridge motor driver IC that allows you to control two DC motors or a single stepper motor. It can drive motors with voltage up to 46V and current up to 2A per channel, hence it's suitable for medium-power applications.
### Key features of the L298:
•	Dual full-bridge drivers (can control two motors independently)<br>
•	TTL logic compatible inputs<br>
•	Separate power supply for logic and motor<br>
•	Built-in diodes for back EMF protection<br>
•	Enable pins for PWM-based speed control<br>
In the given circuit:
•	U1 is the L298 IC<br>
•	U2 is a 7805 voltage regulator used to step down 12V to 5V for logic<br>
•	C1 and C2 are electrolytic capacitors for filtering<br>
•	D1 is an LED with resistor R1 for power indication<br>
### Working of the Circuit
1.	Power Supply:<br>
o	A 12V power source is connected to the circuit.<br>
o	The 7805 voltage regulator (U2) steps this down to 5V for logic components.<br>
o	The 5V output also powers the logic (VS) pin of the L298, while the motor power (VCC) pin is fed with 12V.<br>
2.	Input Control:<br>
o	Inputs IN1–IN4 are connected to a microcontroller or control logic, which sends signals to determine motor direction.<br>
o	ENA and ENB are enable pins, used for speed control via PWM.<br>
3.	Motor Outputs:<br>
o	OUT1–OUT4 are connected to the terminals of two motors.<br>
o	Depending on the input combinations (HIGH/LOW), the motors can rotate forward, backward, or stop.<br>
4.	Diode Protection:<br>
o	The diodes connected across the motor output pins are for flyback protection. They absorb voltage spikes due to back EMF generated by the motors when switching.<br>
5.	Operation Example:<br>
o	If IN1 = HIGH and IN2 = LOW, motor 1 rotates in one direction.<br>
o	Reversing the logic (IN1 = LOW, IN2 = HIGH) makes it rotate in the opposite direction.<br>
o	When both inputs are the same, the motor stops.<br>
